## Intro

In this blog i will show you how i dissected
[redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) source code in order to write a simple
PoC for CVE-2023-28425. Furthermore some tips on how to read the source code of
an open-source project in order to find vulnerabilities of known bugs are
given. Finally i show you how i regularly use chatGPT to find more info about
the target.

## Start

### redis
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is widely used as
a database, cache, and message broker. It was first released in 2009 and has
since become one of the most popular NoSQL databases, thanks to its high
performance, scalability, and flexibility. Overall, Redis is a powerful and
versatile data store that has found widespread use in a wide range of
applications and industries, from social media and
e-commerce to finance and healthcare.


### CVE-2023-28425
As described in the security advisory
[link](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-mvmm-4vq6-vw8c),
an authenticated users can use the MSETNX command to trigger a runtime
assertion and termination of the Redis server process.

<br />

Of course the product owner does not want to expose further information
regarding a vulnerability, as it should be. Our starting point will be the
security advisor/cve bulletin. Assuming the security advisor is correct, we
extract the following info:

 - affected versions `>= 7.0.8`
 - patch applied from version `7.0.10`
 - the vulnerability is simple to trigger and only authenticated users can trigger it
 - after triggering the vulnerability it will be catched by a runtime assertion causing the redis servers to exit (DoS)
 - reporter who've discovered the vuln

<br />

**info gathering**

The first step should be called information gathering, and as the name suggest is the act of collecting knowledge. Of course you can directly go into the codebase, but personally i prefer spending more time on this part. The step is subdivided into:
1. Search CVE on twitter/dorks/github/gitlab
2. Look for keywords on github/gitlab issues and commits sections, in this case "MSETNX" could be a good candidate
3. Follow social activities of the vuln reporter 

During this phase i found: redis internals [notes](https://github.com/zpoint/Redis-Internals), CVE-2022-31144 [POC](https://github.com/SpiralBL0CK/CVE-2022-31144).

<br />

**code inspection**

The step is subdivided in:
1. Compare the patched version with the unpatched version that has the nearest version number to the patched one using git diff.
2. Grep, do search by keywords
3. Use a code navigation tool, for big projects use eclipse, otherwise vim+cscope is better ([link](https://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_vim_tutorial.html))
4. Ask chatGPT to be your assistant


<br />

Let's do the first substep:

```bash
git diff 7.0.9 7.0.10
```

We try looking for the keyword "MSETNX", and after inspecting the diff we find that a test case was added for "MSETNX with not existing keys - same key twice", maybe that's the vuln.

<p align ="center">

</p>

<br />


We ask about the MSETNX command and the vulnerability to chatGPT. To find good
results we need to tell chatgpt to be our assistant. I do this like so: before
making a question related to vulnerabilities, i prefix the following sentence:
`"As a <role> <adjective-role>, your are my assistant."`, with `<role>` being
for example as "Security code auditor, Security researcher, vulnerability
  researcher" and `<adjective>` "skilled, expert", and so on. You can combine
  roles.

Now the question to chatGPT can't be a simple "how to trigger CVE-2023-...",
(or isn't it). Because in first place it will tell you that it does know
nothing after Sept 2021 (like we believe it), and secondly the question could
be labeled as a sensitive question and the answer will be restrictive or
manipulated (e.g. tell me a joke about a man vs. tell me a joke about a woman).

I escape it like so: `"I am analyzing <project-name> project which is hosted on
github at <url>, and i have found the following vulnerability:
"<vulnerability-description>". Can you explain it better and maybe give an
example ?"`.


The final question used:

```
As security code auditor expert and skilled bug bounty hunter, your are my
assistant. I am analyzing redis project which is hosted on github here
https://github.com/redis/redis, and i have found the following vulnerability
"Authenticated users can use the MSETNX command to trigger a runtime assertion
and termination of the Redis server process.", can you explain better and maybe
give an example ?
```

**build the test environemnt**

```bash
# ubuntu 20.04 docker image
git clone https://github.com/redis/redis
cd redis
git checkout 7.0.9
export CFLAGS="-g"
make
cd src

# run redis server
#gdb -ex "run" --args ./redis-server --port 7777
./redis-server --port 7777

# run client
./redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 7777
```

<br />

Let's try the poc given by chatgpt.

<br />


**Vulnerability triaging (?)**

Compile source code with "-g" symbol flag, then after triggering the program
crash inspect function caller stack frame on gdb by `up <#frame>` and `down <#frame>` command. In
our case we do `up 4` and then we give `context` command to update gdb console view.

Cool we found where the runtime assertion happens. Let's inspect the source code. In my case i am using cscope as follows:

```bash

# append this to bashrc or only for the current bash session
# Cscope config
export CSCOPE_EDITOR=`which vim`
alias cscope_cpp="find . -iname '*.cpp' -o -iname '*.c' -o -iname '*.h' -o -iname '*.hpp' -o -iname '*.cc' > cscope.files"
alias cscope_java="find . -iname '*.java' > cscope.files"
alias cscope_py="find . -iname '*.py' > cscope.files"
alias cscope_all="find . -iname '*.cpp' -o -iname '*.c' -o -iname '*.h' -o -iname '*.hpp' -o -iname '*.cc' -o -iname '*.java' -o -iname '*.py' > cscope.files"
alias cscope_database="cscope -q -R -b -i cscope.files"
alias cscope_Clean='rm cscope.in.out cscope.po.out cscope.files cscope.out'

cd redis
cscope_cpp
cscope_database
cscope -d
```

We search on "Find this global definition" section, use "TAB" to move from/to query sections.

<p align ="center">
  <img src="/files/2023-04-02/t9.jpg">
</p>

<br />

So back to `dbAdd` function. We conclude the assert happens because `de != NULL` is true.

```c
/* Add the key to the DB. It's up to the caller to increment the reference
 * counter of the value if needed.
 *
 * The program is aborted if the key already exists. */
void dbAdd(redisDb *db, robj *key, robj *val) {
    sds copy = sdsdup(key->ptr);
    dictEntry *de = dictAddRaw(db->dict, copy, NULL);
    serverAssertWithInfo(NULL, key, de != NULL);
    dictSetVal(db->dict, de, val);
    signalKeyAsReady(db, key, val->type);
    if (server.cluster_enabled) slotToKeyAddEntry(de, db);
    notifyKeyspaceEvent(NOTIFY_NEW,"new",key,db->id);
}
```

<br />

Let's inspect `dictAddRaw` function. With gdb we find that `if ((index = _dictKeyIndex(d, key, dictHashKey(d,key), existing)) == -1)` is true, which means the key is already present on the dictionary and so NULL is returned, which will trigger the assert condition explained before.

```c
/* Low level add or find:
 * This function adds the entry but instead of setting a value returns the
 * dictEntry structure to the user, that will make sure to fill the value
 * field as they wish.
 *
 * This function is also directly exposed to the user API to be called
 * mainly in order to store non-pointers inside the hash value, example:
 *
 * entry = dictAddRaw(dict,mykey,NULL);
 * if (entry != NULL) dictSetSignedIntegerVal(entry,1000);
 *
 * Return values:
 *
 * If key already exists NULL is returned, and "*existing" is populated
 * with the existing entry if existing is not NULL.
 *
 * If key was added, the hash entry is returned to be manipulated by the caller.
 */
dictEntry *dictAddRaw(dict *d, void *key, dictEntry **existing)
{
    long index;
    dictEntry *entry;
    int htidx;

    if (dictIsRehashing(d)) _dictRehashStep(d);

    /* Get the index of the new element, or -1 if
     * the element already exists. */
    if ((index = _dictKeyIndex(d, key, dictHashKey(d,key), existing)) == -1)
        return NULL;

    /* Allocate the memory and store the new entry.
     * Insert the element in top, with the assumption that in a database
     * system it is more likely that recently added entries are accessed
     * more frequently. */
    htidx = dictIsRehashing(d) ? 1 : 0;
    size_t metasize = dictMetadataSize(d);
    entry = zmalloc(sizeof(*entry) + metasize);
    if (metasize > 0) {
        memset(dictMetadata(entry), 0, metasize);
    }
    entry->next = d->ht_table[htidx][index];
    d->ht_table[htidx][index] = entry;
    d->ht_used[htidx]++;

    /* Set the hash entry fields. */
    dictSetKey(d, entry, key);
    return entry;
}
```

<br />

### Tail

In the end the vulnerability is caused by declaring a new key twice on the same `MSETNX` command executed. In particular the vuln is present on `msetGenericCommand` function which is called while parsing `MSETNX k1 val1 k1 val2` command. Because `nx` is not equal to 0, and because none of the keys declared by the command is present on the db, then `setkey_flags |= SETKEY_DOESNT_EXIST;` happens. Then we loop on each key declared and we use the same `setkey_flags`, `setKey(c, c->db, c->argv[j], c->argv[j + 1], setkey_flags);`. Which is correct for the first declaration `k1 val1`, but wrong for `k1 val2` as `k1` was alredy declared and should not have `SETKEY_DOESNT_EXIST` bit set on `setkey_flags`.


```c
void msetGenericCommand(client *c, int nx) {
    int j;
    int setkey_flags = 0;

    if ((c->argc % 2) == 0) {
        addReplyErrorArity(c);
        return;
    }

    /* Handle the NX flag. The MSETNX semantic is to return zero and don't
     * set anything if at least one key already exists. */
    if (nx) {                                                               // [0]
        for (j = 1; j < c->argc; j += 2) {
            if (lookupKeyWrite(c->db,c->argv[j]) != NULL) {
                addReply(c, shared.czero);
                return;
            }
        }
        setkey_flags |= SETKEY_DOESNT_EXIST;                                // [1]
    }

    for (j = 1; j < c->argc; j += 2) {
        c->argv[j+1] = tryObjectEncoding(c->argv[j+1]);
        setKey(c, c->db, c->argv[j], c->argv[j + 1], setkey_flags);         // [2]
        notifyKeyspaceEvent(NOTIFY_STRING,"set",c->argv[j],c->db->id);
    }
    server.dirty += (c->argc-1)/2;
    addReply(c, nx ? shared.cone : shared.ok);
}
```
