### Intro ###
  During my OSED exam preparation I have been learning some stuff about WinDbg
  python/JS API, IDA's IDC language and vague concepts about Windows binary
  analysis. These arguments are not even required for the OSED exam, besides i
  have found them helpful in a lot of occasions, especially in daily job needs.
  I will update this post in order to keep track of the history of this blog
  series, so keep an eye here sometime.

#### Objective ####
  The objective of the series is to accelerate the vulnerability triagging task
  during OSED exams by using binary analysis concepts with Pykd and IDA's IDC
  language. Final materials will be uploaded on
  [osed-binary-analysis-scripts](https://github.com/tin-z/osed-binary-analysis-scripts)
  repo.


#### Requirements ####
  I will assume you already know how to use Windbg and IDA.
