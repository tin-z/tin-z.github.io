### Intro ###
  During my OSED exam preparation I have been learning some stuff about WinDbg
  python/JS API, IDA's IDC language and vague concepts about Windows binary
  analysis. These arguments are not even required for the OSED exam, besides i
  have found them helpful in a lot of occasions, especially in daily job needs.
  I will update this post in order to keep track of the history of this blog
  series, so keep an eye here sometime.

#### Objective ####
  The objective of the series is to accelerate the vulnerability triagging task
  during OSED exams by using binary analysis concepts with Pykd and IDA's IDC
  language.

#### Requirements ####
  I will assume you already know how to use Windbg and IDA.
